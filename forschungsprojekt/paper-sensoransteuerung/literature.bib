  abstract = {Event-driven programming is a popular model for
                  writing programs for tiny embedded systems and
                  sensor network nodes. While event-driven programming
                  can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a
                  state machine programming style which makes many
                  programs difficult to write, maintain, and debug. We
                  present a novel programming abstraction called
                  protothreads that makes it possible to write
                  event-driven programs in a thread-like style, with a
                  memory overhead of only two bytes per
                  protothread. We show that protothreads significantly
                  reduce the complexity of a number of widely used
                  programs previously written with event-driven state
                  machines. For the examined programs the majority of
                  the state machines could be entirely removed. In the
                  other cases the number of states and transitions was
                  drastically decreased. With protothreads the number
                  of lines of code was reduced by one third. The
                  execution time overhead of protothreads is on the
                  order of a few processor cycles.},

                  lifetime measurements of sensor networks. Despite
                  the importance of experimental validation, none of
                  the lifetime models proposed so far has been
                  validated experimentally. One of the reasons for the
                  absence of practical validations might be the long
                  lifetime of batteries which make the validation of
                  the proposed models non-trivial and time
                  consuming. Our solution enables validation of
                  lifetime models within a reasonable amount of
                  time. We also use our method to validate a simple
                  mathematical model that provides bounds on the
                  lifetime of sensor networks.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers of tiny networked devices that communicate
                  untethered. For large scale networks it is important
                  to be able to dynamically download code into the
                  network. In this paper we present Contiki, a
                  lightweight operating system with support for
                  dynamic loading and replacement of individual
                  programs and services. Contiki is built around an
                  event-driven kernel but provides optional preemptive
                  multithreading that can be applied to individual
                  processes. We show that dynamic loading and
                  unloading is feasible in a resource constrained
                  environment, while keeping the base system
                  lightweight and compact.},

  abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks are based on the
                  collaborative efforts of many small wireless sensor
                  nodes, which collectively are able to form networks
                  through which sensor information can be
                  gathered. Such networks usually cannot operate in
                  complete isolation, but must be connected to an
                  external network to which monitoring and controlling
                  entities are connected. As TCP/IP, the Internet
                  protocol suite, has become the de-facto standard for
                  large-scale networking, it is interesting to be able
                  to connect sensornets to TCP/IP networks. In this
                  paper, we discuss three different ways to connect
                  sensor networks with TCP/IP networks: proxy
                  architectures, DTN overlays, and TCP/IP for sensor
                  networks. We conclude that the methods are in some
                  senses orthogonal and that combinations are
                  possible, but that TCP/IP for sensor networks
                  currently has a number of issues that require
                  further research before TCP/IP can be a viable
                  protocol family for sensor networking. }},
