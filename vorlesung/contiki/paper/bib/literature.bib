			the network layer and the link layer for sensor networks.
			SP was proposed as the core of a future-oriented sensor node
			architecture that allows flexible and optimized combination
			between multiple coexisting protocols. This thesis implements
			the SP sensornet protocol on the Contiki operating system
			in order to: evaluate the effectiveness of the original
			SP services; explore further requirements and implementation
			trade-offs uncovered by the original proposal.
			We analyze the original SP design and the TinyOS implementation
			of SP to design the Contiki port. We implement the data sending
			and receiving part of SP using Contiki processes,
			and the neighbor management part as a group of global routines.
			The evaluation consists of a single-hop traffic throughput test
			and a multihop convergecast test. Both tests are conducted
			using both simulation and experimentation.
			We conclude from the evaluation results that SP's link-level
			abstraction effectively improves modularity in protocol
			construction without sacrificing performance,
			and our SP implementation on Contiki lays a good foundation
			for future protocol innovations in wireless sensor networks.}},

                  beacon transmissions are costly when power-saving
                  radio duty cycling mechanisms are used. We show that
                  piggybacking multiple beacons in a single
                  transmission significantly reduces transmission
                  costs and argue that this shows the need for a new
                  layer in the sensornet stackan announcement
                  layerthat coordinates beacons across upper layer
                  protocols. An announcement layer piggybacks beacons
                  and coordinates their transmission so that the total
                  number of transmissions is reduced. With an
                  announcement layer, new or mobile nodes can quickly
                  gather announcement information from all neighbors
                  and all protocols by issuing an announcement pull
                  operation. Likewise, protocols can quickly
                  disseminate new announcement information to all
                  neighbors by issuing an announcement push
                  operation. We have implemented an announcement layer
                  in the Contiki operating system and three data
                  collection and dissemination protocols on top of the
                  announcement layer. We show that beacon coordination

                  heterogeneity, the number of link lay ers, MAC
                  protocols, and underlying transportation mechanisms
                  increases. System developers must adapt their
                  applications and systems to accommodate a wid e
                  range of underlying protocols and
                  mechanisms. However, existing communication
                  architectures for sensor networks are not design ed

                  developer must redevelop thei r systems for each
                  underlying communication protocol or mechanism. To
                  remedy this situation, we present a communication
                  architecture that adapts to a wide range of
                  underlying communication mechanisms, from the MAC

                  the architecture is expressive enough to accommodate
                  typical sensor network protocols. Measurements show
                  that the increase in execution time over a

  abstract = {Event-driven programming is a popular model for
                  writing programs for tiny embedded systems and
                  sensor network nodes. While event-driven programming
                  can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a
                  state machine programming style which makes many
                  programs difficult to write, maintain, and debug. We
                  present a novel programming abstraction called
                  protothreads that makes it possible to write
                  event-driven programs in a thread-like style, with a
                  memory overhead of only two bytes per
                  protothread. We show that protothreads significantly
                  reduce the complexity of a number of widely used
                  programs previously written with event-driven state
                  machines. For the examined programs the majority of
                  the state machines could be entirely removed. In the
                  other cases the number of states and transitions was
                  drastically decreased. With protothreads the number
                  of lines of code was reduced by one third. The
                  execution time overhead of protothreads is on the
                  order of a few processor cycles.},

  abstract = {From experience with wireless sensor networks it has become apparent
that dynamic reprogramming of the sensor nodes is a useful
feature. The resource constraints in terms of energy, memory, and
processing power make sensor network reprogramming a challenging
task. Many different mechanisms for reprogramming sensor nodes have
been developed ranging from full image replacement to virtual
machines.
We have implemented an in-situ run-time dynamic linker and loader that
use the standard ELF object file format. We show that run-time dynamic
linking is an effective method for reprogramming even resource
constrained wireless sensor nodes. To evaluate our dynamic linking
mechanism we have implemented an application-specific virtual machine
and a Java virtual machine and compare the energy cost of the
different linking and execution models. We measure the energy
consumption and execution time overhead on real hardware to quantify
the energy costs for dynamic linking.
Our results suggest that while in general the overhead of a virtual
machine is high, a combination of native code and virtual machine code
provide good energy efficiency. Dynamic run-time linking can be used
to update the native code, even in heterogeneous networks.},

                  the lifetime models proposed so far has been

                  nodes, which collectively are able to form networks
                  through which sensor information can be
                  gathered. Such networks usually cannot operate in
                  complete isolation, but must be connected to an
                  external network to which monitoring and controlling
                  entities are connected. As TCP/IP, the Internet
                  protocol suite, has become the de-facto standard for
                  large-scale networking, it is interesting to be able
                  to connect sensornets to TCP/IP networks. In this
                  paper, we discuss three different ways to connect

                  architectures, DTN overlays, and TCP/IP for sensor

                  senses orthogonal and that combinations are
                  possible, but that TCP/IP for sensor networks
                  currently has a number of issues that require
                  further research before TCP/IP can be a viable

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers---up to thousands---of tiny radio-equipped
                  sensors. Every sensor has a small microprocessor
                  with enough power to allow the sensors to
                  autonomously form networks through which sensor
                  information is gathered. Wireless sensor networks
                  makes it possible to monitor places like nuclear
                  disaster areas or volcano craters without requiring
                  humans to be immediately present. Many wireless
                  sensor network applications cannot be performed in
                  isolation; the sensor network must somehow be
                  connected to monitoring and controlling
                  entities.
                  This thesis investigates a novel
                  approach for connecting sensor networks to existing
                  networks: by using the TCP/IP protocol suite in the
                  sensor network, the sensors can be directly
                  connected to an outside network without the need for
                  special proxy servers or protocol converters.
                  Bringing TCP/IP to wireless sensor networks is a
                  challenging task, however. First, because of their
                  limited physical size and low cost, sensors are
                  severely constrained in terms of memory and
                  processing power. Traditionally, these constraints
                  have been considered too limiting for a sensor to be
                  able to use the TCP/IP protocols. In this thesis, I
                  show that even tiny sensors can communicate using
                  TCP/IP. Second, the harsh communication conditions
                  make TCP/IP perform poorly in terms of both
                  throughput and energy efficiency. With this thesis,
                  I suggest a number of optimizations that are
                  intended to increase the performance of TCP/IP for
                  sensor networks.
                  The results of the work
                  presented in this thesis has had a significant
                  impact on the embedded TCP/IP networking
                  community. The software developed as part of the
                  thesis has become widely known in the community. The
                  software is mentioned in books on embedded systems
                  and networking, is used in academic courses on
                  embedded systems, is the focus of articles in
                  professional magazines, is incorporated in embedded
                  operating systems, and is used in a large number of
                  embedded devices.}

                  devices such as sensors to an existing network
                  infrastructure such as the global Internet has
                  steadily increased. Such devices often has very
                  limited CPU and memory resources and may not be able
                  to run an instance of the TCP/IP protocol suite. In
                  this thesis, techniques for reducing the resource
                  usage in a TCP/IP implemen- tation is presented. A
                  generic mechanism for o²oading the TCP/IP stack in a
                  small device is described. The principle the
                  mechanism is to move much of the resource demanding
                  tasks from the client to an intermediate agent known
                  as a proxy. In par- ticular, this pertains to the
                  bu®ering needed by TCP. The proxy does not require
                  any modi¯cations to TCP and may be used with any
                  TCP/IP implementation. The proxy works at the
                  transport level and keeps some of the end to end
                  semantics of TCP. Apart from the proxy mechanism, a
                  TCP/IP stack that is small enough in terms of
                  dynamic memory usage and code footprint to be used
                  in a minimal system has been developed. The TCP/IP
                  stack does not require help from a proxy, but may be
                  con¯gured to take advantage of a supporting proxy.}

                  transmission significantly reduces transmission
                  costs and argue that this shows the need for a new

                  layerthat coordinates beacons across upper layer
                  protocols. An announcement layer piggybacks beacons
                  and coordinates their transmission so that the total
                  number of transmissions is reduced. With an
                  announcement layer, new or mobile nodes can quickly
                  gather announcement information from all neighbors
                  and all protocols by issuing an announcement pull
                  operation. Likewise, protocols can quickly
                  disseminate new announcement information to all
                  neighbors by issuing an announcement push

                  collection and dissemination protocols on top of the
                  announcement layer. We show that beacon coordination

                  sensor nodes is essential both for evaluating
                  existing sensor network mechanisms and for
                  constructing new energy-aware mechanisms. We present
                  a software-based mechanism for estimating the energy
                  consumption of sensor node at run-time. Unlike
                  previous energy estimation mechanisms, our mechanism
                  does not require any additional hardware components
                  or add-ons. Our demonstration shows the energy
                  estimation in practice on a small network of Tmote
                  Sky motes running the Contiki operating system. A PC
                  connected to one of the motes shows the real-time
                  energy estimation of the network nodes and where the
                  energy is spent: CPU active, CPU sleeping, radio
                  transmitting, radio listening, and LEDs}

                  heterogeneity, the number of link lay ers, MAC
                  protocols, and underlying transportation mechanisms
                  increases. System developers must adapt their
                  applications and systems to accommodate a wid e
                  range of underlying protocols and
                  mechanisms. However, existing communication
                  architectures for sensor networks are not design ed
                  for this heterogeneity and therefore the system
                  developer must redevelop thei r systems for each
                  underlying communication protocol or mechanism. To
                  remedy this situation, we present a communication
                  architecture that adapts to a wide range of
                  underlying communication mechanisms, from the MAC
                  layer to the transport layer, without requiring any
                  changes to applications or protocols. We show that
                  the architecture is expressive enough to accommodate
                  typical sensor network protocols. Measurements show
                  that the increase in execution time over a
                  non-adaptive archit ecture is small.},

  abstract = {Event-driven programming is a popular model for
                  writing programs for tiny embedded systems and
                  sensor network nodes. While event-driven programming
                  can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a
                  state machine programming style which makes many
                  programs difficult to write, maintain, and debug. We
                  present a novel programming abstraction called
                  protothreads that makes it possible to write
                  event-driven programs in a thread-like style, with a
                  memory overhead of only two bytes per
                  protothread. We show that protothreads significantly
                  reduce the complexity of a number of widely used
                  programs previously written with event-driven state
                  machines. For the examined programs the majority of
                  the state machines could be entirely removed. In the
                  other cases the number of states and transitions was
                  drastically decreased. With protothreads the number
                  of lines of code was reduced by one third. The
                  execution time overhead of protothreads is on the
                  order of a few processor cycles.},

  abstract = {From experience with wireless sensor networks it has become apparent
that dynamic reprogramming of the sensor nodes is a useful
feature. The resource constraints in terms of energy, memory, and
processing power make sensor network reprogramming a challenging
task. Many different mechanisms for reprogramming sensor nodes have
been developed ranging from full image replacement to virtual
machines.
We have implemented an in-situ run-time dynamic linker and loader that
use the standard ELF object file format. We show that run-time dynamic
linking is an effective method for reprogramming even resource
constrained wireless sensor nodes. To evaluate our dynamic linking
mechanism we have implemented an application-specific virtual machine
and a Java virtual machine and compare the energy cost of the
different linking and execution models. We measure the energy
consumption and execution time overhead on real hardware to quantify
the energy costs for dynamic linking.
Our results suggest that while in general the overhead of a virtual
machine is high, a combination of native code and virtual machine code
provide good energy efficiency. Dynamic run-time linking can be used
to update the native code, even in heterogeneous networks.},

                  useful only when connected to an external
                  network. Previous research on transport layer
                  protocols for sensor networks has focused on
                  designing protocols speci cally targeted for sensor
                  networks. The deployment of TCP/IP in sensor
                  networks would, however, enable direct connection
                  between the sensor network and external TCP/IP
                  networks. In this paper we focus on the performance
                  of TCP in the context of wireless sensor
                  networks. TCP is known to exhibit poor performance
                  in wireless environments, both in terms of
                  throughput and energy ef ciency. To overcome these
                  problems we introduce a mechanism called Distributed
                  TCP Caching (DTC). The DTC mechanism uses segment
                  caching and local retransmissions to avoid expensive
                  end-to-end retransmissions.We show by simulation
                  that DTC signi cantly improves TCP performance so
                  that TCP can be useful even in wireless sensor

  abstract = {In contrast with work focusing on routing problems
                  in mobile ad hoc networks, this work addresses the
                  problem of system configuration in such networks. In
                  particular, we are interested in ways to instantiate
                  the configuration infrastructure -- naming,
                  addressing, authentication, and key distribution --
                  needed to establish small-to-medium scale ad hoc
                  networks supporting collaborative applications. We
                  argue that, in such spontaneous networks,much of the
                  necessary infrastructure can be derived from the
                  face-to-face human interactions that these networks
                  are intended to facilitate. This approach has the
                  additional advantage of being intuitive for the
                  non-expert user.}

                  range of applications, devices, and underlying

                  lightweight and runs on tiny, battery operated
                  embedded devices. IP therefore has all the qualities

                  constrained systems such as embedded
                  systems. Software for memory constrained embedded
                  systems sometimes are based on an event-driven model
                  rather than on multi-threading. While event-driven
                  systems allow for reduced memory usage, they require
                  programs to be developed as explicit state
                  machines. Since implementing programs as explicit
                  state machines is hard, developing, maintaining, and
                  debugging programs for event-driven systems is
                  difficult.
                  Protothreads simplify implementation of
                  high-level functionality on top of event-driven
                  systems, without significantly increasing the memory
                  requirements. Protothreads can be implemented in in
                  the C programming language using 10 lines of code
                  and 2 bytes of RAM per protothread.}

  abstract = {With sensor networks starting to get mainstream
                  acceptance, programmability is of increasing
                  importance. Customers and field engineers will need
                  to reprogram existing deployments and software
                  developers will need to test and debug software in
                  network testbeds. Script languages, which are a
                  popular mechanism for reprogramming in
                  general-purpose computing, have not been considered
                  for wireless sensor networks because of the
                  perceived overhead of interpreting a script language
                  on tiny sensor nodes. In this paper we show that a
                  structured script language is both feasible and
                  efficient for programming tiny sensor nodes. We
                  present a structured script language, SCript, and
                  develop an interpreter for the language. To reduce
                  program distribution energy the SCript interpreter
                  stores a tokenized representation of the scripts
                  which is distributed through the wireless
                  network. The ROM and RAM footprint of the
                  interpreter is similar to that of existing virtual
                  machines for sensor networks. We show that the
                  interpretation overhead of our language is on par
                  with that of existing virtual machines. Thus script
                  languages, previously considered as too expensive
                  for tiny sensor nodes, are a viable alternative to
                  virtual machines.},
